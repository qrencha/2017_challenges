# 2017_challenges
For the year 2017 I've resolved to write 12 to 24 coding challenges, once every two weeks or every month. The idea is to use different programming languages like Processing, Python, JAVA, etc... They will be updated with new features during the year.

	Challenge 1 - Proceesing - Minion
	Challenge 2 - Proceesing - Multiplication Game
	Challenge 3 - Proceesing - Dancing Air Man
	Challenge 4 - Proceesing - Car Dashboard
	Challenge 3p5 - P5js - Dancing Air Men
